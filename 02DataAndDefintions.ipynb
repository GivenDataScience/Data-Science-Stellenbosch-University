These data can be captured as words. There are also two subtypes of categorical data. __Ordinal categorical data__ have an inherent order to them. Think of the Likert style selection for a survey question. On this scale, respondents might choose _strongly disagree_, _disagree_, _neither agree nor disagree_, _agree_, and finally, _strongly agree_. This is an example of a five-point Likert scale. There is a natural order to these values. They can even be encoded as numbers, i.e. $1,2,3,4$, and $5$. Note, though, that these are not true numbers.

After surgery we are given pain releavers, known as analgesics. A pain scale can be used to measure the amount of pain expeienced. These scales typically vary form $0$ indicating no pain to $10$, the most severe pain. These are once again not true numbers. For one, there is no fixed difference between consecutive values. We cannot state that the difference between a pains core of $2$ and $3$ is the same as the difference between $8$ and $9$. Pain is subjective. We can also not state that a pain score of $6$ is twice as much pain as a score of $3$. Lastly, we cannot express these results as an average. Such an average over many patients might be $3.7$.

Imagine then a study looking at soil type in an area divided into different section. In one section there might be sandy soil and silt. In yet another there might be sandy soil, loamy soil, and clay.

The column headers in a spreadsheet is the first row that are the names of the different statistical variables. While we used the variable same _soil type_, this is actually not acceptable. For ease of analysis in Python do not use illegal characters such as spaces. A better name would be _soil\\_type_ (called snake-case) or _soilType_ (called camelCase).

This can be driven by the user, allowing empty rows, colouring, and all manner of calculations and plots in a spreadsheet. Individual columns can also be formatted to express percentages when fractions are entered or monetary units when money values are entered. These serve no purpose when analysing data and can lead to frustration. Save files in the universal comma separated values (CSV) format instead of the program proprietary format at all times.
